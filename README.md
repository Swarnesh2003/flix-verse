We all enjoy watching movies and shows, but sometimes there are scenes we'd rather skip—such as long fight sequences, random songs, or moments that don’t align with our preferences.
We have developed an AI-powered streaming platform that automatically skips unwanted scenes based on user configurations while keeping the story smooth and uninterrupted. This way, viewers can take control of their viewing experience without missing any important plot points.


Our AI model detects and analyzes scenes in a movie using two layers:
Layer 1 - Audio Feature Analysis for Scene Classification
When a movie is received, the model detects scenes based on pixel changes and motion detection.
Once the scenes are identified, the audio from each scene is extracted and converted into a standardized format. This formatted audio is then analyzed to extract key features required for scene classification. These features include MFCCs, Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Spectral Contrast, Tempo, and more.
The extracted features are passed to our model, which has been trained on a variety of YouTube videos using the same feature extraction process. The model then predicts and classifies each scene based on its audio characteristics.
Once the audio-based classification is complete, the second layer of analysis begins.


Layer 2 - Video Analysis for Scene Classification
For each detected scene, a set of frames is extracted from the video and passed to a Generative AI model for classification. This model performs a two-step analysis: image recognition and pattern detection.
By analyzing motion, objects, and the overall context of the video—along with specific patterns such as aggressive postures—our model classifies scenes accordingly.
Scene Classification and Filtering


The combined results from both layers determine the classification of each scene into categories such as songs, fight sequences, dialogues, mature content, etc.
The system then compares the detected scenes with the user's preferences and filters out unwanted content. This allows viewers to watch a movie while skipping unnecessary or undesirable scenes, ensuring that the storyline remains intact.
